### Minor Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/47) [`213d6c1`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/213d6c133b1872b0a6f1f26f637ad07d262800e4) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - `soundor dev` reloads the plugin UI on every change.

  - The CLI watches the project and rebuilds the UI bundle; each successful build writes a `build-id` last. A failed build is reported and the last good build keeps running.
  - The JUCE debug build loads the UI from disk instead of embedding it and replaces its JavaScript runtime with a fresh one on each new build (new native `DevSession`).
  - The plugin's console output and uncaught errors are written to `.soundor/dev/ui.log` and shown in the `soundor dev` terminal, with stack frames source-mapped to the TypeScript.
  - `UiBundleContext` gains `live` (with `logFile`) in dev: runtimes should load and reload such a UI rather than embed it.

- [#46](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/46) [`f925d60`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/f925d60fcccd3adb98aeec89532eb5d35d51ed53) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - Plugin UIs are TypeScript/TSX bundled with tsdown and run inside the plugin.

  - `soundor dev`/`soundor build` bundle `src/main.tsx` (or `.ts`/`.jsx`/`.js`) into one ES module: npm packages inlined, `soundor:*` imports kept, minified for production, source-mapped for development. Image imports (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`) become content-addressed assets. Runtimes receive the bundle as `ctx.ui`.
  - The JUCE runtime compiles the bundle into the plugin and the editor's runtime evaluates it.
  - `soundor gen` emits `globals.d.ts`: the Web APIs the runtime provides and image imports, for `lib: ["ES2023"]` projects without DOM types.
  - New projects get a `src/main.ts` entry and runtime-appropriate tsconfigs.

- [#51](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/51) [`f0218c6`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/f0218c64b04ce2f091229891a9a91493914f5efe) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - New projects and the example are React apps, and two Soundor plugins are proven to coexist in one host.

  - `create-soundor-app` scaffolds a `src/main.tsx` React UI with `@soundor/react`.
  - `soundor:host`'s `snapshot()` returns the same object until the host state changes, so it works with `useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, snapshot)`. A fresh object on every call made React loop.
  - A coexistence test loads two copies of the runtime under different ABI namespaces into one process and runs them interleaved, unloading and reloading them. A JUCE host test does the same with two real VST3s and their editors.

- [#50](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/50) [`b2565bd`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/b2565bd3ed572c5e0460a52df1cb515c09e77e06) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - `@soundor/react`: React for plugin UIs, rendering into the plugin view.

  - A react-reconciler renderer for `soundor:ui`: `render()`, `createRoot()`, `flushSync()`.
  - React Native–style components: `View`, `Text` (strings and nested `<Text>` flattened), `Image`, `ScrollView` (`contentContainerStyle`), `TextInput` (`value`/`onChangeText`, `onSubmitEditing`), `Pressable` (state-dependent `style` and `children`), with Web-style event props and capture variants.
  - `StyleSheet`, style arrays, and hooks: `useParameter()` and `useAnimationFrame()`.
  - `@soundor/core` ships the project-independent runtime declarations (`@soundor/core/runtime/ui.d.ts`, `globals.d.ts`) for packages written against `soundor:ui`.
  - **Breaking:** the previous `@soundor/react` (hooks over the WebView bridge) is replaced entirely.

- [#49](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/49) [`48b126c`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/48b126c2b37514bb3102db5e9717b0f3c36851bd) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - The plugin view is drawn: a Skia renderer and the UI primitives.

  - Skia (m144) is built from source at a pinned commit, CPU-only (no GPU, PDF, SVG, ICU or HarfBuzz), once per machine into Soundor's cache directory. It needs git, Python 3 and ninja, which `soundor doctor` now checks. Its symbols stay hidden inside each plugin.
  - `soundor:ui` draws backgrounds, borders, per-corner radii, opacity, clipping, text in the platform's fonts (with fallback), images, scroll views and text inputs. Styles take CSS colors (`color`, `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`), `borderRadius`, `opacity` and `resizeMode`.
  - New primitives: `createImage()`, `createScrollView()`, `createTextInput()` (editing, selection and clipboard as default actions; `input`/`change` events; UTF-16 indices), `pressable()`, `clipboard`, and global `requestAnimationFrame`/`cancelAnimationFrame`.
  - The JUCE editor renders the UI into its view, repainting only when it changed, and uses the system clipboard.
  - The symbol check now also fails on Objective-C classes compiled into a binary (Apple platforms).
  - **Breaking:** `ui::TextMeasurer` is replaced by `ui::TextEngine`; `RuntimeHost::Options::textMeasurer` is now `textEngine` and defaults to the renderer's fonts.

- [#44](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/44) [`9e54964`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/9e549648cc02a34e4e4e6c6c02713cf73089a656) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - **Breaking:** parameters reach JavaScript through `soundor:parameters`, the plugin view hosts Soundor's JavaScript runtime, and the WebView-era UI stack is removed.

  - `soundor:parameters` exposes every config parameter as a typed object (`get`, `set`, `subscribe`, `beginGesture`/`endGesture`, `info`), backed directly by the JUCE `AudioProcessorValueTreeState`. Changes from the audio thread reach subscribers on the UI thread through lock-free flags. `soundor gen` emits its declaration as `parameters.d.ts` (`soundor.d.ts` references both module declarations); `parameters.ts`/`parameters.json` are no longer generated.
  - JUCE plugins now build the Soundor runtime (QuickJS-NG, fetched at a pinned revision) into the plugin under a per-plugin ABI namespace. Each editor hosts a runtime, and processors supply `soundor:native` by overriding `createNativeApi()`.
  - Removed: the `@soundor/bridge` and `@soundor/react` packages, the CLI's Vite UI build and dev server, `virtual:soundor/bridge`, the runtime contract's `bridgeModule()` and `dev.ui`/`build.ui` contexts, the example and template DOM UI, and the parameter `onChange` field.

- [#42](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/42) [`9b4473e`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/9b4473e111e72768af25e38a50e33b3641e2b9d3) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - **Breaking:** the plugin's identity moves to a top-level `plugin: { id, name }`, `nativeMethods` is replaced by a typed `native` API, and the JUCE WebView UI is removed.

  - `plugin.id` (reverse-DNS) and `plugin.name` are required. JUCE uses them as `BUNDLE_ID` and `PRODUCT_NAME`. `juceRuntime()` options are flattened to JUCE-only settings (`jucePath`, `formats`, `companyName`, `pluginCode`, `manufacturerCode`); the codes default to stable values derived from `plugin.id`.
  - `native: { types, methods }` declares structs, enums, opaque handles and methods, including `async` ones. `soundor gen` emits `native.d.ts` (the `soundor:native` module), and the JUCE runtime generates a C++ `soundor::native::NativeApi` interface plus validated, zero-copy QuickJS bindings for it.
  - The JUCE editor no longer hosts a `WebBrowserComponent`: there is no bridge manifest, native allowlist, embedded UI bundle or dev-server URL. `@soundor/juce-runtime/bridge` is removed. The editor is an empty plugin view until the native UI lands.

- [#48](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/48) [`1a6e00b`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/1a6e00b1dca06f87af6c05854c90c0e32ad6e43f) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - New `soundor:ui` module: the plugin view as a tree of nodes with flexbox layout and DOM-style input events.

  - `root`, `createView()`, `createText()`: `UiNode`s are `EventTarget`s with `appendChild`/`insertBefore`/`removeChild`, a React Native–style `style` (flexbox, spacing shorthands, percentages, absolute positioning, gaps, `pointerEvents`, text properties), `layout` and `getBoundingClientRect()`.
  - Layout by Yoga v3.2.1, pinned and built privately with hidden symbols.
  - Normalized input: pointer capture, hover enter/leave, clicks, wheel, keyboard, text input and focus with Tab navigation. Delivered as `PointerEvent`, `WheelEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, `FocusEvent` and `InputEvent`, which capture and bubble along the tree.
  - `EventTarget` events now run capture, target and bubble phases when targets form a tree; `stopPropagation()` and `composedPath()` behave as on the Web.
  - The JUCE editor sizes the view's surface and forwards mouse, wheel and keyboard input; unhandled keys and wheel input go on to the host.
  - `soundor gen` emits `ui.d.ts` with the module's types.
