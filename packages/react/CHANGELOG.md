# @soundor/react

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/51) [`f0218c6`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/f0218c64b04ce2f091229891a9a91493914f5efe) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - New projects and the example are React apps, and two Soundor plugins are proven to coexist in one host.

  - `create-soundor-app` scaffolds a `src/main.tsx` React UI with `@soundor/react`.
  - `soundor:host`'s `snapshot()` returns the same object until the host state changes, so it works with `useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, snapshot)`. A fresh object on every call made React loop.
  - A coexistence test loads two copies of the runtime under different ABI namespaces into one process and runs them interleaved, unloading and reloading them. A JUCE host test does the same with two real VST3s and their editors.

- [#50](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/50) [`b2565bd`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/b2565bd3ed572c5e0460a52df1cb515c09e77e06) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - `@soundor/react`: React for plugin UIs, rendering into the plugin view.

  - A react-reconciler renderer for `soundor:ui`: `render()`, `createRoot()`, `flushSync()`.
  - React Native–style components: `View`, `Text` (strings and nested `<Text>` flattened), `Image`, `ScrollView` (`contentContainerStyle`), `TextInput` (`value`/`onChangeText`, `onSubmitEditing`), `Pressable` (state-dependent `style` and `children`), with Web-style event props and capture variants.
  - `StyleSheet`, style arrays, and hooks: `useParameter()` and `useAnimationFrame()`.
  - `@soundor/core` ships the project-independent runtime declarations (`@soundor/core/runtime/ui.d.ts`, `globals.d.ts`) for packages written against `soundor:ui`.
  - **Breaking:** the previous `@soundor/react` (hooks over the WebView bridge) is replaced entirely.
