### Minor Changes

- [#164](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/164) [`f75bc0c`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/f75bc0ca9a76077bdb9b3e7df28cfa5d3b3dbab2) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - DevTools targets have no owner any more: every signed-in client (dashboard tabs, Soundor Driver, `soundor driver`) reads, highlights, picks, records and sends input at the same time, as several mice and keyboards share one computer. The engine keeps each client's synthetic pointer, held keys, highlight and picker apart, draws every client's highlight, and releases only a client's own input when it disconnects. The performance recording is shared and stops once every client that started it is gone.

  Breaking: the protocol is version 2. `Control.acquire`/`Control.release`, `LEASE_BUSY`/`LEASE_REQUIRED` and targets' `controller` are removed; runtime requests carry the sending `client`, and `resetControl` is replaced by `clientGone`. The Driver drops `acquireControl()`, `releaseControl()` and `hasControl`; the dashboard drops **Request control**; `soundor driver` exit code 6 now means the target is busy.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#163](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/163) [`e02159e`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/e02159eb8eb68a989a4dea8f405efdca9dff7798) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - Soundor Driver screenshots: the engine captures its view as it renders it, as PNG (`capture` capability, `Capture.screenshot`), and the JUCE bridge uploads it to the DevTools server as binary, which keeps it as a short-lived capture clients read with their session cookie (bounded in size, number and lifetime). `driver.screenshot()`, `locator.screenshot()` and `soundor driver screenshot <path>` save it; DevTools previews and downloads it. Locators gain `waitFor()` and `isVisible()`, and a missing debug ID lists the ones there are.

- [#162](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/162) [`3fe72a1`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/3fe72a188cef8f8a1b9eb4f49d5107cf41ac4096) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - Soundor Driver input: the engine dispatches synthetic pointer, wheel and keyboard input through its own hit testing, capture and event dispatch (`input` capability; `Input.dispatchPointer`, `dispatchWheel`, `dispatchKey`, `typeText`, `focus` and `UI.hitTest` in the DevTools protocol), on a pointer of its own, and releases whatever it holds when control is released, the client goes or the UI reloads. `@soundor/driver` adds `pointer`, `keyboard`, control leases and locator actions (`click`, `hover`, `drag`, `dragTo`, `scroll`, `focus`, `press`, `type`) that wait until a node is actionable; `soundor driver` adds `click`, `hover`, `focus`, `move`, `drag`, `scroll`, `key` and `type`; DevTools offers Click, Hover and Focus on the selected node. The engine decodes runtime commands itself, and `Surface::key(input, typed)` is the shared key entry of the JUCE editor and synthetic input.

### Patch Changes

- [#145](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/145) [`1d7eb63`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/1d7eb63cc2c4288f05e34bdfe7cfc5af82ad4ccf) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - Centralize guides and package references in `docs/`, with a documentation index,
  page navigation, and package README links that also work on npm. Add a project
  README and guides covering the idea, architecture, getting started, project
  lifecycle, parameters, and contributing.

## 0.9.0

### Patch Changes

- [#137](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/137) [`ee85daa`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/ee85daa245fe5f71f2faa90eafb9b86db2f6026a) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - Name the source repository and directory in every package, so npm links each package to its source and resolves its README's relative links.

- [#135](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/135) [`421939b`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/421939b530a63aaaf15d0761a4b3c553279efd70) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - Render the DevTools dashboard with React and React DOM, preserving native inspection, control ownership, diagnostics, authentication, and reconnect behavior. Keep protocol orchestration separate from declarative views and clean up the React root on disposal.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#128](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/pull/128) [`5ec0815`](https://github.com/soundor/soundor/commit/5ec081578c4f7667e5942cf1ca8e8c8d172a195a) Thanks [@dm-balakin](https://github.com/dm-balakin)! - Extract DevTools into an independent Node server and TypeScript/Vite application,
  preserving the shared protocol and dashboard behavior. Add secure optional static
  serving, headless operation, reusable simulated runtimes and scenarios, standalone
  frontend development, browser E2E coverage and packed-consumer validation.

  Allow Vite development to attach to an existing loopback backend through an
  explicit CLI Origin opt-in, retaining normal browser authentication and backend
  ownership. Derive simulated tree roots from the current fixture nodes.

  Separate browser session handling, protocol state, and dashboard rendering into
  focused client modules. Cover state transitions with DOM-independent tests,
  model cancellable simulated operations without error side effects, and isolate
  frontend development tests with ephemeral ports. Canonicalize localhost browser
  bootstrap links onto the explicitly trusted loopback origin.
