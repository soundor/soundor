**Breaking:** natively, plugin UIs run on Hermes, not QuickJS-NG: `eval()` and `new Function()` throw, private class members and `let`/`const` follow the lowered semantics below, and a call into JavaScript that runs past `juceRuntime({ timeLimit })` (5 s by default) is stopped. Runtime authors: the CLI's UI bundle context gains `ctx.ui.module` (the ES module) beside `ctx.ui.entry` (now the native CommonJS form), and the native `RuntimeStatistics` counts collections instead of allocations. The `soundor` CLI needs Node `^22.18.0 || >=24.11.0` (Babel 8).

The JUCE runtime runs JavaScript on Hermes's interpreter instead of QuickJS-NG (no JIT; no Static Hermes). A built plugin embeds its UI bundle as Hermes bytecode, compiled at build time by the `hermesc` of the same pinned Hermes build, and links the VM without its compiler; `soundor dev` evaluates source and reloads as before. Hermes is built from source once per machine into Soundor's cache (several minutes, the first time), with hidden symbols, and its heap running out is an error instead of an abort: such a context fails from then on and is recreated on reload.

Hermes has no ES modules, so the CLI now writes the UI bundle twice: `bundle.mjs`, the ES module the Web runtime loads (`ctx.ui.module`), and `bundle.js` (`ctx.ui.entry`), the native runtime's form: a CommonJS module function with classes, block scoping, private members, async functions and async generators lowered for Hermes by `@soundor/core`'s new `toNativeModule()` (Babel). `soundor:*` imports and application sources are unchanged.

What changes for plugin code running natively: `eval()` and the `Function` constructors throw (a built plugin has no compiler, and `soundor dev` fails the same way), so code generated at run time needs a form made at build time; private class members are properties keyed by symbols of their own (fast, but visible to `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()`, and unchecked: reading one on another object gives `undefined`); `let`/`const` have no temporal dead zone (reading one before its declaration gives `undefined`); on Linux, `localeCompare` and dates' `toLocaleString()` ignore the user's locale. Each context has a garbage-collector thread of Hermes's own. Built-ins Hermes lacks (FinalizationRegistry, `queueMicrotask`, Set methods, iterator helpers, `toSorted`, `Promise.withResolvers`, ArrayBuffer `transfer()`...) are provided; Atomics, SharedArrayBuffer, Float16Array, `Intl` and `Symbol.species` are not. `RuntimeStatistics` counts garbage collections (`collections`) instead of allocator calls.

A UI script that never returns no longer freezes the host for good: `juceRuntime({ timeLimit })` (milliseconds, 5000 by default; `false`: none) bounds each call into JavaScript (a frame, an event, a timer, startup), past which the engine stops it with a `TimeoutError` JavaScript cannot catch; the error is logged and the context fails from then on, until the editor is opened again or `soundor dev` reloads. Natively, `RuntimeOptions::timeLimit` and `js::TimeLimitScope`. Native objects behind `soundor:native` handles are released on the UI thread, at the next tick after the collector finalizes their handles, never on the collector's own thread.
