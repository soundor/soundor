`soundor dev` prints a summary when the runtime is ready (plugin, DevTools URL, and what the runtime adds), collapses the native build output into one progress line in a terminal (all of it is kept in `.soundor/dev/build.log`), and takes shortcuts: `o` opens DevTools signed in, `c` copies a signed-in link, `u` shows the summary again, `q` quits. Runtimes report readiness and add shortcuts through the new `ctx.session`; the JUCE runtime adds `s` to relaunch the Standalone, the Web runtime `w` to open the Web host.
