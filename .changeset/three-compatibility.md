Three.js's `WebGLRenderer` runs unmodified on Soundor's WebGL 2. The native tests cover it against the npm package, pinned. Nodes' styles can now be written one property at a time (`node.style.width = 120`, which is how Three's `setSize()` writes it), and lengths accept CSS pixels (`'120px'`), in both runtimes.
